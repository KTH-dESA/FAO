  scenarios:
    title: Scenario information
    body:
      - Reference scenario
      - Domestic demands are assumed to increase over time with growing population of 1.4% per year and the total irrigated area is assumed to stay constant.
      - Desalination scenario
      - Addition of 275,000 m3/day of desalination capacity in 2021, of which 150,000 m3/day for Agadir and 125,000 for m3/day for Chtouka agriculture. Expands to 450,000 m3/day in 2030 with equal share between both regions.
      - Irrigation Intensification scenario
      - Includes the desalination project and considers expansion of greenhouses for vegetable crops in Chtouka and Souss sub-basins. The levels of greenhouses increases from 5,409 ha in 2020 to 14,919 ha in 2030.
  climate:
    title: Climate change variables information
    body:
      - Scenarios are run under two climate change futures
      - Current temperature trend and historical precipitation (1980-2010).
      - Higher rate of temperature increase and repeat of historical dry period (1980-1987).
  cost:
    title: Technology cost reduction information
    body: This parameter represents a future trend in cost reduction, due to market price drop and maturity of the technology.
  price:
    title: Electricity price reduction information
    body: This parameter represents an increase in electricity price from the grid, due to factors as new policies, reduction of subsidies or increase in power generation costs.
  butane:
    title: Butane phase-out information
    body:
      - Three phase-out scenarios for Butane can be explored as follows
      - Business as usual scenario, which assumes the current share of butane use to continue into the future
      - Late Phase out, which assumes complete phase-out of butane by year 2040.
      - Early Phase out, which assumes complete phase-out of butane by  year 2030.
  pv adoption:
    title: Solar PV adoption information
    body:
      - Two levels of PV share in the region can be explored.
      - Low PV Share, which assumes the current level of PV share of 10% to continue in the future.
      - Moderate PV Share, which assumes an increase of PV share from 10% to 20% by year 2040.
      - High PV Share, which assumes an increase of PV share from 10% to 50% by year 2040.

  title: About the Souss-Massa Nexus model
  body:
    - This platform provides the means to explore the modelling results of the project titled “Implementing the 2030 Agenda for water efficiency/productivity and water sustainability in the Souss-Massa basin in Morocco”. The project is funded by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and the Stockholm Environmental Institute (SEI) are providing analyses and support on decision making across the climate, land, energy and water spheres.
    - The Nexus analysis developed for the Moroccan Souss-Massa basin, softlinks a water balance model developed by SEI using the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP), and a GIS-based energy model developed by KTH.
    - The model uses WEAP for estimating water supplies based on climate-driven hydrological routines that calculate rainfall runoff and groundwater recharge. It estimates usage patterns for the main water sectors, evaluates the productivity of cropping systems under different climate futures and assess their impact on energy and water systems.
    - Furthermore, the energy component implements GIS-based methodologies to estimate energy requirements for groundwater and surface water pumping, new water desalination projects and major wastewater treatment plants. Finally, least-cost generation technologies to supply electricity for water and agricultural sectors are identified.
